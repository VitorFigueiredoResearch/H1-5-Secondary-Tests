# H1.5 — Secondary Tests of the H1 Kernel

This repository contains secondary analyses of the frozen H1 phenomenological
model, testing its behavior against independent observables such as:

- Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation (BTFR)
- (Planned) weak lensing consistency checks

No re-fitting or modification of the H1 kernel is performed.
All analyses operate strictly on published H1 outputs.
